I created a reddit "change my view" thread, arguing that Casinos would go bankrupt if people were better at math.
One poster's post contained the following:


I've never gone gambling before, but there's a fairly simple strategy to win money almost everytime, as long as you start off with quite a bit of money.
Let's say you have 1000, find a roughly 50/50 game and initially bet 10, if you lose, bet double that, and then keep going until you win, you only have to win one to go into profit. Once you win that one time you reset back to $10, rinse and repeat.


Since it would only take a couple of minutes, I decided to write a simulator of this gambling strategy. The result is that you always lose all your money in about 200 to 300 rounds. Try it yourself.
